# Responsive
Hii, I'm Om Kale in this project I create a mini webpage using only "HTML, CSS and JavaScript".
The special part of this project that is it is a Responsive. I know that is not special but this my first responsive design I ever make.
In this I used "Media Queries" to make it responsive.

The responsive design helps to access a website in mobile and other devices against desktop.

In this mini project I understood how we can make a responsive webpage.

After this I use this concept in other coming projects and improve my web developing skill and be a good Web Developer.

Thank You!!
